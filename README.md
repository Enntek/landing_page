# odin-landing-page

So far, in these Odin lessons I have learned how to write boilerplate HTML to start a file and learned several HTML elements to setup a webpage.
I have learned how to link a .css file to that webpage to help style it. One of the skills Odin has put special emphasis on is Flexbox.
In this project, we will use what we've learned of HTML and CSS to create a webpage with a defined layout, a landing page. This page will make extensive
use of Flexbox and put everything we've learned to the test.
